<!--
This markup represents the Friend Smash Coin product object.

We define a title, a plural title (for the common event where we sell more than
one of the unit), an image to represent the object (found in the /images
directory of the sample), the url of this Open Graph object on the public
internet and a description to show to the player when they go to purchase the
item.

Be sure to replace the og:url and og:image URLs with the address where you are
hosting the objects on the web.

Additionally, we have defined several
  product:price:currency
  product:price:amount
pairs, which express the cost of one Friend Smash Coin in various local
currencies.

For example, in US Dollars, 1000 Friend Smash Coins is worth $29.99,
whereas in British Pound Sterling, 1000 Friend Smash Coins is worth £19.99.

Defining a range of prices for each local currency allows you to target prices
specifically to regions of the world and create a native buying experience for
users in that country.

When players try to buy Friend Smash Coins, they will be shown the price in
their local currency. If their local currency is not defined in this Open Graph
object, the price will be generated by converting from the default currency
(the first currency you define) based on Facebook's current exchange rates.
